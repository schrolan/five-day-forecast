# five-day-forecast
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
I have just about everything for this project. I need to work on how it looks and I need to get it so the button that pops up actually does what it needs to. You can enter a city name and a weather forecast for that day will show up along with the five following days. And an image that is related to the weather does show up describing the weather.
